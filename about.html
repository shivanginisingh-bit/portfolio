                <p>Hi! I'm based out of Bangalore.</p>
                <p>I've been designing experiences for over 12 years across enterprise and consumer products. My focus is turning complexity into clarity—building AI-assisted workflows, scalable design systems, and journeys that feel effortless for people and effective for business.</p>
                <p>I believe experiences can be delightful while being functional. I enjoy the full stack of design, but my strengths are empathy, collaboration, and divergent thinking. When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me reading, illustrating, doing yoga, aqua-scaping, or learning to shoot videos—anything that keeps me curious and connected to the world around me.</p>

She is made for design- products, services, systems, experiences, and ventures across virtually every domain and industry. Her versatility makes her a dream professional in today's interdisciplinary world while speaking volumes of her nuanced work experience. Shivangini is also rare because she is someone you'd also want to know outside of work. Despite her deep experience and professional achievements, she remains humble, curious and spirited. She has an uncanny ability to connect with everyone. These skills explain her success as a team leader and will only make a stronger case for her as she progresses toward executive leadership roles. She'd be an asset to any organization and I will continue to follow her achievements with great interest.

                    Shivangini is a motivated and versatile UX designer. I am working with her on a project which started off as a mere POC and has scaled up to draconian levels. Her UX/Visual designs are instrumental in scaling up by enabling the UI developer to create an application with pleasing aesthetics and adaptive functionalities. During our work we always had healthy discussions regarding where the product was moving towards. Our goals were never only on what comes now, but far reaching, where the product could go towards. Her empathy with the team is integral in keeping the show going. She always welcomes ideas and suggestions from everyone in the team to share their views and ideas which would then be distilled with the Partners product goals into a viable design. She never shirked from working on new issues. She always faced problems head-on and worked through or around issues so that timely solutions can be obtained. With Shivangini in the team, from envisioning the user journey to communication, she has it all covered.
